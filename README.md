# bidirectional-instances

This repository provides a prototype implementation of type inference with translation to System Fc of type classes with bidirectional instances, as presented in the paper ``Bidirectional Type Class Instances'' by Koen Pauwels, Georgios Karachalias, Michiel Derhaeg and Tom Schrijvers. This prototype was primarily developed by Michiel Derhaeg.

Once you have built the executable `prototype` using your favorite tool, you can call it on files with

    prototype <filename>

You can find examples of input files in folder `Tests`, illustrating the syntax the prototype accepts. The above command either fails (if the program is ill-typed), or prints the following:

1. The elaborated program
2. The inferred Haskell type of the "main" program (top-level expression at the end of the file)
3. The program theory (all rules generated by class and instance declarations)
4. The inferred System FC type of the "main" program (top-level expression at the end of the file)
